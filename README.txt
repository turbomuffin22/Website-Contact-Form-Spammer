This website form submission spammer can be used on any website with a contact form type layout. Simply change the "get_element_by_id" selenium commands to match the website you're looking to spam.

There is also a twilio module imported to send yourself a text message when your bot reaches certain milestones. Change out the phone numbers with your twilio account number, the phone number you want to text to and your twilio token number and you're all set with that.

I left a website listed in the browset.get command, along with a bunch of pre-made spamming commands so you can see it work before you change out the values and variables for your own.

Also, the list files the program will call on are pasted into the python file itself, instead of calling on other files. The idea was to make the most powerful website contact form spammer I could, while keeping it easy enough for anyone to use. I thought having the lists inside the same file made things a little more understandable for people that may be new to python. Feel free to write a new FORK of the project if you want to move the list files to seperate files to clean it up a bit.

Have fun!
